                    1. Data Pattern Analysis:
                       - Check for seasonality patterns
                       - Identify trends
                       - Look for cyclical patterns
                       - Assess data frequency (daily, monthly, yearly)
                       - Evaluate data completeness and quality
                       - Check for outliers and anomalies

                    Quantitative Techniques:
                    - Historical Data Method (best for stable, consistent historical patterns)
                    - Time Series Analysis (for data with clear seasonal patterns)
                    - Econometric Modeling (for data with multiple influential variables)
                    - Predictive Sales Analytics (for complex patterns with multiple factors)
                    - Moving Averages (for smoothing short-term fluctuations)
                    - Regression Analysis (for clear linear relationships)
                    - ARIMA (for non-seasonal time series with trends)

                    Qualitative Techniques:
                    - Delphi Method (for long-term forecasting with expert opinions)
                    - Market Research (for new products/markets)
                    - Consumer Surveys (for direct consumer feedback)
                    - CPFR (for supply chain collaboration)
